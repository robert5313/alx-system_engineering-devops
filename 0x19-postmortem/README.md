t is postmortem?
A postmortem is a written record of an incident that describes:

The incident's impact.
The actions taken to mitigate or resolve the incident.
The incident's root cause.
Follow-up actions taken to prevent the incident from happening again.
At Atlassian, we track all postmortems with Jira issues to ensure they are completed and approved. You may decide to use a simpler system, like a Confluence page for each postmortem, if your needs are less complex.
